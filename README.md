R-Programming

Download the project and set your working directory. I used several graphs to perform analysis on FIFA players. Add more interesting finding to this project. Enjoy!

In this project I used the data set provided by Kaggle. The name of the data set is “FIFA 19 Complete player Dataset”. This dataset includes 18K FIFA plater with around 90 attributes from the latest FIFA database. This dataset comes under Football Analytics and contains detailed attributes for every player registered in the latest edition of FIFA 19 database.The web scrapping is already done from “https://sofifa.com/”.

I analyzed the dataset of players with their attributes likes Age, Nationality, Preferred Foot, Skill Moves, Value etc. The knowledge from the R language course helped me in finding the interesting facts about this dataset.

This Project was part of the "R-Programming" course in ITU. As I go through the R lectures I will keep on adding the features to the Final Project.
